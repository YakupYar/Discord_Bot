# Discord_Bot
This is a discord bot. You send a photograph and write "$check" it saves your  photograph and if your  photograph is a  technological device it says what  technological device it is and says you the confidence score.


HOW DID I DID THIS:

- I did this with visual studio code and thanks to my teacher (Deniz Dağlı) i did this very easly.
- I used google teachable machine to teach my discord bot to realize what did i just sent him.
- It's very easy to use google teachbable machine if you dont know you can look it on youtube.
- I connected my code to a visual enviroment.
- Then with my teachers help i did this very easly.
- If you want to do this reach my teacher(Deniz Dağlı)
